# Brain-Tumor-MRI-using-CNN
This project classifies brain tumors using EfficientNetB0 &amp; B1 on MRI images. It distinguishes glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor using deep learning. The model is evaluated with accuracy/loss curves, confusion matrices, and random image predictions, aiming for ~98% accuracy with efficient performance. ðŸš€
